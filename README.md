# XAFFLE: Decentralized Raffle Smart Contract

## Overview

XAFFLE is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate decentralized raffles with non-fungible token (NFT) prizes on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows participants to acquire entries using various cryptocurrencies, and the winner is randomly selected by the contract, ensuring fairness and transparency in the selection process.

## Features

- **Flexible Entry Mechanism**: Participants can acquire entries using different cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to Ether, XDC, Matic, etc.

- **Random Winner Selection**: The contract autonomously selects the winner from the pool of participants who have acquired entries, ensuring fairness and transparency in the raffle process.

- **Owner Control**: The owner of the contract has the authority to start and end the raffle, set the NFT prize, change the entry cost, withdraw contract balances, and reset the contract if necessary.

- **Security Measures**: The contract includes robust security measures to prevent manipulation or tampering with the raffle process, ensuring the integrity of the raffle and the safety of participants' funds.

## Usage

To use the XAFFLE smart contract:

1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Set the parameters for the raffle, including the entry cost, NFT prize, and any additional requirements (e.g., minimum number of entries).
3. Participants can acquire entries by interacting with the contract using various cryptocurrencies.
4. Once the raffle ends, the contract autonomously selects a winner from the pool of participants who acquired entries.
5. The winner receives the NFT prize, and the contract can be reset for future raffles.
